    ## HASHES ##
Windows holds 2 types of hashing
  Lanman: 
    - Old password hashing mechanism                                EX.) Password : BuDdy12&
    - Converts all letters to uppercase                                  Converts : BUDDY12&                                            Password : LONGERTHAN14BY5CHAR 
    - Pads out to 14 characters or truncates down to 14                  Pads     : BUDDY12&______    or if longer than 14 characterS   Trunks to: LONGERTHAN14BY
    - Splits to 2 7 bit chunks                                           Splits   : BUDDY12 | &______
    - Creates 2 DES keys for the password hash                       DES Encrypt  : *****DESKEY1***** | *****DESKEY2*****
    - Weak password storage system

  NT: 
    - Modern password storing mechanism                            EX.) Password : BuDdy12&
    - Converts password to unicode                                      Unicdoe  : B\x00u\x00D\x00d\x00y\x001\x002\x00&\x00
    - MD4 hashes the unicode string                                     MD4      : *******Encripts String*******
    - Encrypted by choice of encryption

  ## Cracking ##
Combining /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
  'sudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow' : combines the files and replaces the X in /etc/passwd (X stands for in another file) and /etc/shadow

John the Ripper
  'john unshadow.txt' : used with the unsadow command ^

Hashcat
  - Utilizes attack modes using -a
  - saves output in a .potfile to a preset filepath
-a options
  0 : straight forward attack. Uses 1 wordlist to crack.
  1 : Combinator attack. Uses 2 wordlists and appends the second list to the words in the first list.
  3 : Mask Attack. You supply the hash mask for hashcat.
  6 : Hybrid wordlist+ Attack. Appends digits to wordlists to build out passwords

  ## Safe Practices ##
- Disable LANMAN on Windows
- Make hashes hard to crack, hard to get, or valueless
    Valuless - Like a 2 factor auth. If password is comp then its not useful without the other auth system.
