    ---- SERVER-SIDE REQUEST FORGERY ----

Application accepts a URL from a user. Server requests the content from another server requested from the user. Utilizes that transaction to recieve more data than what should be given.

Ex.
Regular request:
  login.falsimentis.com/?f=Twitter&logo=https://cdn.cdnlogos/t/29/twitter.svg
    - normal Twitter login page for the company falsimentis
SSRF:
  login.falsimentis.com/?=Twitter&logo=file:///etc/hosts
    - Calling for a request for of the /etc/hosts file on the server


---- UTILIZING cURL ----  

Command line URL utility (cURL)

'curl "https://login.falsimentis.com/?=Twitter&logo=file:///etc/hosts"'
  - if normal users can see the file, then the output will return in terminal


  ---- Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) ----

In cloud systems, a IMDS "server" is running along the physical server. IMDS is a virtual server
  - 169.254.169.254 is the ip. Only accessible from the the local machine.

AWS is vulnerable if its using IMDSv1 not IMDSv2
  - IMDSv2 is not set as default

  ---- EXTRA INFO ----

Cloud systems aren't made for multi user setups
  - /etc/shadow will not give the best info
  - Look for /var/www/html/auth.config.js

Cloud systems normally run everything as root
  - Creds are often stored as environment variables
  - On Linux, accessible in /proc/NNN/environ or /etc/environment
  - NNN is the process id. Note: Probaly have to guess the id
